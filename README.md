# TERMS AND CONDITIONS
*A Legal Thriller*

## What?
It's an entry for NaNoGenMo 2015 (see: https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015).  It generates an incomprehensible legal document, and you can sign it if you dare.

## How?
* Pull from corpus/, which includes the ToS and EULAs for a number of Popular Websites.  Throw in GPLv3 for good measure.
* Markov chains.
* Profit!

## Why?
* An interesting diversion from my main entry
* A commentary on the now ubiquitous Terms of Service, a block of legalese we have become instinctively trained to skip and click "I Agree".

## And?
* Licensed under WTFPL, which is the most diametrically-opposed license I could find to what the tool actually generates.
* Various documents in corpus are probably NOT WTFPL.  Sue me :P
